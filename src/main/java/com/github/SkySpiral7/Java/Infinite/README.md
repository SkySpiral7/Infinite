#InfiniteInteger
This class can represent any integer with perfect precision. This class has no maximum value but BigInteger does have a maximum value
which is approximately 2^(2^31). This class is convenient but is not designed to be efficient.


#InfinitelyLinkedList
This class is a list without a maximum size unlike an array which has a maximum of approximately 2^31 elements.
This data structure requires InfiniteInteger but should otherwise be efficient (as much as it can be which isn't much).
