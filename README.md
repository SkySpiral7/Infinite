Java
====
This repository is a holder for stand alone files or very small projects.
This was once part of the Miscellaneous repo but was separated to make it easier
to have a Java project in Eclipse.

#Tests
As expected "src" contains the code and "tests" contain the tests.
The tests run off of junit-4.11 with hamcrest-all-1.3.


#Branches
The master branch contains code that is done and well tested.

The "untested" branch contains code that has no tests and is possibly half finished.
The code might have unfinished or buggy functions but every other function worked under my use conditions.
The test folder is currently a place holder for test suites that will be made to validate the code.
If a test suite is finished for the code they will be moved to the master branch
If the untested branch remains empty for a while, it will not be deleted but instead act as a place holder for new code.
